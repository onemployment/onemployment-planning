## Conversation-Gated Technical Design Flow (One Step at a Time)

**Policy:** Complete the technical design template **step-by-step in conversation**. Do **not** finish the full template in a single turn. Advance **only** after the user explicitly approves the current step.

**Steps (strict order):**
0. **System Context Discovery** (NEW - establishes architectural baseline)
1. **Requirements Analysis & Scope Definition**
2. **Data Model Design**
3. **API Design & Integration Points**
4. **Frontend Architecture & Components**
5. **Technology Stack & Dependencies**
6. **Testing Strategy**
7. **Implementation Plan & Task Breakdown**
8. **Deployment & Infrastructure Plan**
9. **Design Review & Approval**

**Per-step micro-protocol:**
- **S0. Context Discovery** (NEW) — Load specific details needed for this step only (see Context Discovery Guide below)
- **S1. Summarize** what's known so far (≤5 bullets).
- **S2. Probe** with 2–4 targeted questions; when helpful, propose 2–3 clearly labeled options.
- **S3. Draft** a concise candidate section (≤7 bullets) **for this step only**.
- **S4. Gate for approval** — end with:
  _"Reply **approve step {n}** to accept, or provide edits. I won't continue until you approve."_
- **S5. Update GitHub issue** — when the user replies `approve step {n}`:
  1. Update the GitHub issue section with approved content
  2. Mark checklist item as completed `[x]`
  3. Update "Current Step" field to next step
  4. Update labels to reflect progress
  5. Append `(✅ Approved YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm TZ)` to the section
  6. Then proceed to the next step

**Do not advance if:**
- The user provides edits or asks questions → **revise current step** and re-gate.
- The user is silent → **wait for explicit approval** (do not auto-advance).
- The user says "pause/park" → acknowledge and pause.

**Allowed exceptions (explicit opt-in only):**
- If the user says "auto-advance" or "finish without pauses," you may complete remaining steps; otherwise, **never**.

**GitHub Issue handling:**
- Build the Technical Design content incrementally as steps are approved
- Use the standard GitHub Technical Design template structure
- Keep all template headings intact; add approved content **under the matching heading**
- When all 9 steps are complete and approved, provide the final GitHub issue content

**User control keywords (you may remind the user of these):**
- `approve step {n}` — accept current step
- `edit step {n}: …` — provide changes
- `back to step {n}` — revisit a prior step
- `next` — proceed only if the current step has been explicitly approved
- `pause` — halt progression until resumed

**Output rule:** Never include drafts for **future steps** in the same message. Each message must cover **only the current step** until approved.

**Behavior:** Execute the steps below **without asking follow‑ups** unless the user explicitly provides specific requirements.

### Step 1 — Initialize Technical Design & Create GitHub Issue

* If the user provides a feature request number, reference it.
* Set title: `[DESIGN] ${feature-description} – ${YYYY-MM-DD}`
* **Immediately create GitHub issue** using `mcp__github__create_issue` with:
  - Complete template structure with placeholder sections
  - Initial labels: `technical-design`, `step-0-context`
  - Feature Request reference
* Store the created issue URL/number for subsequent updates
* Begin the 10-step technical design process with live GitHub issue updates

### Step 2 — GitHub Issue Template Structure (Created in Step 1)

Initial GitHub issue template created with placeholder sections:

```markdown
# [DESIGN] [Title]

**Related Feature Request:** onemployment-planning#[number]
**Complexity Assessment:** [To be determined during requirements analysis]

## GitHub Integration Best Practices

**Issue Linking:** Always recommend linking to:
- Related Feature Requests: `Epic: onemployment-planning#X`
- Implementation Tasks: Cross-repository task references
- Dependencies: `Depends on: repository#Y`

**Project Board Management:**
- Add to [Development Process board](https://github.com/orgs/onemployment/projects/1)
- Progress through columns: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
- Update labels as design progresses through steps

**Implementation Task Planning:**
- Break design into repository-specific tasks
- Provide story point estimates (1-3 scale)
- Identify dependencies and sequencing requirements
- Coordinate cross-repository integration points

---

## Template Structure (for GitHub Issues)

Ensure the final issue content includes these sections:

* **Related Feature Request** (Link to originating feature request)
* **Complexity Assessment** (1-5 rating with clear justification)
* **Design Process Checklist** (10 steps with completion status)
* **Step 0: System Context Discovery** (Architectural baseline and integration points)

## Example Workflow

**User:** "Create a technical design for feature request #45 - user profile photo upload"

**Agent Response:**
```
I'll help you create a comprehensive Technical Design for user profile photo upload (Feature Request #45) using our 10-step collaborative architecture process. I'll create a GitHub issue immediately so we can work on this across multiple sessions if needed.

**Creating GitHub Issue...**
*[Agent uses mcp__github__create_issue to create issue with template placeholder structure]*

✅ **GitHub Issue Created:** https://github.com/onemployment/onemployment-planning/issues/123
📋 **Labels:** technical-design, step-0-context
🔗 **Feature Request:** Referenced onemployment-planning#45

**Step 0: System Context Discovery**

Let me first gather the current architectural context to ensure our design aligns with existing patterns:

*[Agent navigates to ../backend and reads prisma/schema.prisma, examines User model]*
*[Agent reviews ../frontend/src/features/auth patterns and Redux state management]*
*[Agent checks ../infrastructure/architecture.md for AWS S3/CloudFront setup]*

**Current System Understanding:**
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, existing User model with profile fields
- Backend: Express.js with feature-based API structure, Zod validation, JWT auth
- Frontend: React 19 with Redux Toolkit, feature-based architecture, existing auth flow
- Infrastructure: AWS ECS + S3 + CloudFront already configured for static assets
- Authentication: JWT-based with existing middleware patterns

**Context Roadmap for Subsequent Steps:**
- Step 2: Extend existing User model in prisma/schema.prisma
- Step 3: Follow existing API patterns in src/api/user/
- Step 4: Integrate with features/auth/ structure and existing user management
- Step 8: Leverage existing S3 + CloudFront infrastructure

Reply **approve step 0** to accept this system context, or provide edits. I won't continue until you approve.
```

**After User Approves:**
```
✅ Step 0 approved! Updating GitHub issue...

*[Agent updates GitHub issue with Step 0 content, marks checklist item complete, updates current step]*

**Issue Updated:** https://github.com/onemployment/onemployment-planning/issues/123
**Progress:** Step 0 ✅ | Current: Step 1 - Requirements Analysis
**Labels:** technical-design, step-1-analysis

**Multi-Session Note:** You can pause here and resume later - all progress is saved in GitHub!

Moving to Step 1: Requirements Analysis & Scope Definition...
```

This approach ensures thorough technical design while maintaining the systematic step-by-step approval process and GitHub integration.
