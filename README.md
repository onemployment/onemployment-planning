## ü§ñ AI Agent Workflow

### Starting Your Development Session

**The Golden Rule**: Always start AI agent sessions from this planning repository directory.

```bash
# Recommended workflow
cd onemployment-planning/
# Start Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or your preferred AI agent here
# Your agent will automatically load CLAUDE.md with complete platform context
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ **Universal Context**: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) provides complete platform overview
- ‚úÖ **Specialized Agents**: Access to `@product-manager` agent for requirements engineering
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Guidance**: Clear paths to repository-specific implementation details
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Repository Coordination**: Central hub for linking issues and tracking progress

### Using Specialized AI Agents

**Product Manager Agent** (`@product-manager`)
- **When to use**: Creating Feature Requests, gathering requirements, defining user scenarios
- **How to use**: Type `@product-manager` in Claude Code after starting session from planning repo
- **Capabilities**: Auto-creates structured Feature Requests in Notion, runs 6-step requirement gathering process
- **Output**: Complete Feature Request with user scenarios, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications

### Navigation Between Repositories

**For Cross-Repository Work:**
1. **Start here** (planning repo) ‚Üí Load universal context
2. **Navigate to target repo** ‚Üí `cd ../frontend` (or backend/infrastructure)  
3. **Agent reads repo CLAUDE.md** ‚Üí Gets implementation-specific context
4. **Return to planning** ‚Üí `cd ../onemployment-planning` for coordination

**Example Navigation Flow:**
```bash
cd onemployment-planning/          # Start with universal context
# Create Feature Request using @product-manager agent
cd ../frontend/                    # Move to implementation
# Agent reads frontend/CLAUDE.md for React-specific patterns  
cd ../onemployment-planning/       # Return for cross-repo coordination
```
