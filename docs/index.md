# onemployment Development Process

## Overview
This repository manages the development process for the onemployment platform across three main repositories:
- [onemployment/frontend](https://github.com/onemployment/frontend) - React/TypeScript user interface
- [onemployment/backend](https://github.com/onemployment/backend) - Node.js/TypeScript API
- [onemployment/infrastructure](https://github.com/onemployment/infrastructure) - AWS infrastructure as code

## Workflow

### 1. Feature Request
Use the Feature Request template to document:
- Problem definition and user scenarios
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Business value and MVP priority

### 2. Technical Design  
Create collaborative technical design with 9 steps:
1. Requirements Analysis & Scope Definition
2. Data Model Design
3. API Design & Integration Points
4. Frontend Architecture & Components
5. Technology Stack & Dependencies
6. Testing Strategy
7. Implementation Plan & Task Breakdown
8. Deployment & Infrastructure Plan
9. Design Review & Approval

### 3. Implementation Tasks
Break approved designs into specific tasks:
- Estimate effort in story points (1-3 scale)
- Include complete context and acceptance criteria
- Create tasks in appropriate repositories

### 4. Development & Tracking
- Work on tasks using provided context
- Track completion with actual effort comments
- Conduct weekly estimation reviews

## Story Point Scale
- **1 point** = Half day (~4 hours)
- **2 points** = Full day (~8 hours)  
- **3 points** = Two days (~16 hours)

## Current Process Status
- **Phase:** Initial implementation and testing
- **Focus:** Estimation accuracy improvement
- **Review Cadence:** Weekly for first month, then monthly
